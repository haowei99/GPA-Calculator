# Inspiration
The Double Degree students have trouble managing the different mark conversions and grading systems between the two universities. This application was created just to make a common grading ground using the 4.0 calculations for students. The application relieves the burden of looking up conversions each time and making it overall more convenient to know their marks.

# What it does
This GPA Calculator is an Android application tailored specifically for Double Degree students at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. It accounts for the difference in mark conversions between the two university and contains a third "university" known as Utopia you help cheer up students and motivate them. It has the specific mandatory courses listed for them so they will not miss out. 

# How we built it
We used Android Studio to build the application. With android studio, the interface is written using XML and the features present in android studio to help us design. We also used Java files and numerous modules to help with the back-end like the actual calculations and the keyboard restrictions. There were no APIs used and everything was created from scratch by us. 

# Challenges we ran into
With limited knowledge of Java, XML, and Android Studio, we struggled immensely to create even the most basic of features. We did not know the syntax well nor any data structures. However, through a lot of research and working together we were able to self-teach ourselves all different aspects of android studio and programming logic. We also were able to learn the syntax for java and xml well. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a project completely from scratch while starting with no knowledge about any of this. Although a simple application, it specific tailoring can also bring convenience to our fellow peers. We had learned a tremendous amount from this and hope this is just the start of many other amazing things we will create. 

# What we learned
From starting off with no coding experience and no knowledge of android studio, we have come a long way utilizing all resources we can find. That is the life a university student.

# What is next for DD-GPA
We wish to fix up the UI/UX a bit as a template is made already and complete this application for the upper year double degree students as it is only for first years right now.
